     <p>The Kingdom of Lesotho is a small landlocked country within South Africa, known for its towering mountain peaks and breathtaking vistas. 
       Lesotho has something for every traveller, from outdoor activities, exploring historical sites or getting off the grid like never before.
       The city I would love to vist is Maseru, the capital and lagest city in Lesotho. I want to visit this because the city has the most beatiful watefalls,
       it is rich with history and has many activities and attractions inspired by nature. Also, Maseru has something of a mix-and-match architectural style, 
       with thatched huts neighbouring concrete office blocks and proud old colonial buildings, which is something I wanna see</p>

      <p class="mar">I would like to learn Shona, merely because I have many friends who speak the language and would like to engage when they are speaking the language too. 
        Also it is known that the more you use your brain to learn new skills, the more your brain's functions work. 
        Learning a new language pushes your brain to get familiar with new grammar and vocabulary rules. 
        It allows you to train your memory to remember new words, make connections between them, and use them in contextual situations</p>

 The Hector Pieterson Memorial and museum opened in Soweto in 2002, not far from the spot where 12 year-old Hector was shot on the 16 June 1976 during the Soweto uprising that today is a symbol of resistance to the brutality of the apartheid government.
